# Design ideas

## Landing page

When not logged in, should just be a simple graphic with a login menu, taking inspiration from the landing page of facebook and instagram. Eventually a personal graphic and brand logo will be created.

## Logged in

Taking inspiration from the Gusto app for the sidebar navigation menu, header and central activity space.

Sidebar menu  option will be highlighted while being viewed.

Sidebar menu options:
- Summary
  - Access data info
  - book data high level overview
- Library
  - menu for selecting which book to look at
  - Once a book is selected, Can see and edit data associated with progress through the book
- Problem sets
  - a Lot to be decided here
